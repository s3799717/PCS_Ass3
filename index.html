Her interest in IT sparked when she met her stepfather, who is a Security Data Architect. She further realised how massive the influence of IT is in all areas of jobs. Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.

                    <p>Assignment 2 was a success, although we lost park in only one part which has taught us valuable lessons as we move on to Assignment 3. In Assignment 2, we divided the work equally and worked in them independently. Now, in Assignment 3 we realised how important working as a group and discussing topics and tasks as a group is. So, now before working individually on each of our assigned tasks, we discuss what the task is asking first and the information that it requires and what we expect as a group to see written on those parts. This change in our process has proved to be really helpful as we worked through finishing assignment 3.

            <p> Git repository has been a helpful instrument in completing this project. Through Git, we were able to identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed and what time they have submitted their work. We also learned from assignment two how cloning and keeping a master copy to our selves helps in not messing up the code and not losing someone else’s work when two or more members of the group commit to change at the same time. Git is also an easy to use as the platform. It is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT.

                Although, towards the end I have slowly interest and begun getting busy again as work started back on, but having such a helpful team still made this assignment successfully good.

            Bank is very attentive and has done so much for this group assignment. He completed his parts earlier more than anyone in this team I believe. Having him in this group even last minute is a great thing that happened.

                After working for months, we got to know each other better through our assignments. It was great to collaborate with a team who is friendly and helpful same time. PCS group was in touch every time when ever we need each other through our tasks. Each member worked hard to get the achieved result in the time frame we had. It was great to work with a team like PCS which made me realize what team spirit is.

            Working with such an excellent group is my pleasure during these ten weeks. I have learnt a lot from the tight cooperation in our assignment. When we met a problem, we were happy to discuss and share the idea together, which made me feel good. Compared with the last time’s working, I think I am more frequent to communicate with my group members.

            After several weeks' collaboration, Me as a member who joined the PCS team late after the team was established.
            I feel grateful to join this team. I think we cooperate better than the last time.
            For example, We are more familiar with each other so that we can freely exchanging ideas no matter it is good or bad.
            In addition, thanks for other three team members in the PCS, the assignment went well because of the great leadership of Catherine.
            One thing I am surprised about is that the team works together and solve problems together no matter how small the question is.
            Lastly, Since we do our section separately and individually, I think the Github log of activity can reflect when and who is doing their job, which is important as a group.
